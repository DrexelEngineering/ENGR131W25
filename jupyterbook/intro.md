## Welcome to **ENGR131: Introduction to Programming for Engineers** at Drexel University! 🎉🐉

👋 **Hello, Future Problem Solvers!**

Welcome to the course that’s going to turbocharge your engineering brain 🧠 with one of the most powerful tools in the world—**Programming**! Think of this as your ticket to becoming the Tony Stark of your generation (minus the flying suit… unless you build one here, which we fully encourage). 🚀

### **Why Programming?**

Let’s face it, engineers don’t just build bridges or design circuits anymore—they program them to think, to optimize, and to **wow**. 💡

- Ever wonder how rockets land themselves? 🛰️ **Programming.**
- Curious about how AI designs new materials? 🤖 **Programming.**
- Interested in controlling a 3D printer to build futuristic designs? 🖨️ **Yep, programming.**

By the end of this course, you’ll know how to make a computer dance to your tune 🎶 (metaphorically... but if you want to code an actual dance bot, we’d love to see it).

### **Your Superpower Awaits**

By the end of ENGR131, you’ll be equipped with the programming skills to turn **ideas into reality**. Whether it’s simulating a robot arm or optimizing energy systems, you’ll have the tools to **engineer the future**. 🚀🌍

So buckle up, engineers, because we’re about to embark on a journey where **logic meets creativity**, and **math meets magic**. Let’s **code, build, and innovate** together!
